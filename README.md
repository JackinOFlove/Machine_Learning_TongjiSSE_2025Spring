## Labs

- **Lab 1**: Polynomial logistic regression with model evaluation (ROC/PR curves, cross-validation)
- **Lab 2**: Regression and classification algorithm comparison (OLS, KNN, SVM, decision trees)
- **Lab 3**: MNIST digit recognition using deep learning (CNNs in TensorFlow/Keras, transfer learning)

## Final Project

**Research and Improvement of Temporal Point Process Models**

Proposed a rule-aware event prediction framework on medical event sequences using improved temporal point process models. Evaluated on three real-world datasets (Stroke, Sepsis, Coroheart) and compared with CLUSTER, CLNN, and TELLER.
